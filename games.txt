8. IMPLEMENTATION GUIDES
==================================================

-----------------
GUIDE 1: BASIC IFRAME EMBEDDING
-----------------

STANDARD IFRAME CODE:
```html
<iframe
  src="[GAME_URL]"
  width="100%"
  height="600px"
  frameborder="0"
  allowfullscreen
  title="Animal Game"
  loading="lazy"
  sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
></iframe>
```

REACT COMPONENT EXAMPLE:
```jsx
import React from 'react';

export function AnimalGame({ gameUrl, title }) {
  return (
    <div className="game-container">
      <iframe
        src={gameUrl}
        width="100%"
        height="600px"
        frameBorder="0"
        allowFullScreen
        title={title}
        loading="lazy"
        className="animal-game-iframe"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

RESPONSIVE IFRAME:
```css
.game-container {
  position: relative;
  padding-bottom: 75%; /* 4:3 Aspect Ratio */
  height: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.game-container iframe {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
```


-----------------
GUIDE 2: EMBEDDING IN REACT
-----------------

METHOD 1: Simple Iframe Component
```jsx
// components/GameEmbed.tsx
interface GameEmbedProps {
  gameUrl: string;
  title: string;
  aspectRatio?: string;
}

export const GameEmbed: React.FC<GameEmbedProps> = ({
  gameUrl,
  title,
  aspectRatio = "75%"
}) => {
  return (
    <div style={{ paddingBottom: aspectRatio, position: 'relative', height: 0 }}>
      <iframe
        src={gameUrl}
        title={title}
        style={{
          position: 'absolute',
          top: 0,
          left: 0,
          width: '100%',
          height: '100%',
          border: 'none'
        }}
        allowFullScreen
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

METHOD 2: Self-Hosted Game Component
```jsx
// For games you host yourself
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

export const SelfHostedGame: React.FC = () => {
  const gameRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Initialize game in the div
    if (gameRef.current) {
      // Your game initialization code here
    }
  }, []);

  return <div ref={gameRef} className="game-canvas" />;
};
```


-----------------
GUIDE 3: MOBILE OPTIMIZATION
-----------------

ENSURE MOBILE COMPATIBILITY:
1. Use responsive iframe wrapper
2. Test touch controls
3. Add viewport meta tag
4. Use CSS media queries
5. Test on actual devices

VIEWPORT META TAG:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1">
```

MOBILE-FRIENDLY STYLES:
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .game-container {
    padding-bottom: 100%; /* Taller on mobile */
  }

  .game-controls {
    font-size: 1.2rem; /* Larger touch targets */
  }
}
```


-----------------
GUIDE 4: PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
-----------------

LAZY LOADING:
```jsx
import { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

const AnimalGame = lazy(() => import('./components/AnimalGame'));

function GamesPage() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading game...</div>}>
      <AnimalGame />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

IFRAME LAZY LOADING:
```html
<iframe src="game.html" loading="lazy"></iframe>
```

ONLY LOAD WHEN VISIBLE:
```jsx
import { useInView } from 'react-intersection-observer';

export const LazyGame = () => {
  const { ref, inView } = useInView({
    triggerOnce: true,
    threshold: 0.1
  });

  return (
    <div ref={ref}>
      {inView ? <iframe src="game.html" /> : <div>Scroll to load game...</div>}
    </div>
  );
};
```
